Polar Bear Population Predictive Modelling

This repository uses Time Series Forecasting methods for the Predictive Modeling of Population Dynamics using Sea Ice Data. It includes data processing, trend analysis, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Concepts

### Predictive Modeling
Predictive modeling is a statistical or machine learning technique used to predict future outcomes based on historical data. It involves creating a model that maps input features to desired output targets. In this project, predictive modeling is used to estimate **sea ice extent** based on past data, including cyclical trends, yearly patterns, and changes over time.

Key steps in predictive modeling include:
1. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the data for modeling.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Add meaningful features, such as rolling averages or cyclical transformations, to capture trends and patterns.
3. **Model Training**: Use algorithms (e.g., Random Forest) to learn relationships between input features and target variables.
4. **Evaluation**: Test the model's accuracy on unseen data using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R¬≤.

### Time Series Forecasting
Time series forecasting is a specialized form of predictive modeling that focuses on data collected at regular time intervals. The goal is to predict future values by understanding temporal dependencies and trends in the data. 

Key components of time series data:
- **Trend**: Long-term increase or decrease in the data.
- **Seasonality**: Recurring patterns or cycles (e.g., annual sea ice changes).
- **Noise**: Random variation that cannot be explained by the model.

In this project:
- Time series forecasting helps predict daily sea ice extent and area.
- Features like **sine/cosine transformations** of the day and **rolling averages** capture seasonal and trend effects.
- Yearly and daily information are combined with these features to enhance forecast accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on [Dryad Digital Repository](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.f68m0), specifically from Regehr et al. (2017). It contains:
- Daily measurements of **sea ice extent** and **sea ice area** for the Chukchi and Southern Beaufort Seas.
- Metadata describing the data structure.

### Original Fields:
- **YEAR**: Calendar year of observation.
- **DAY**: Day of the year (1-365).
- **SEA_ICE_EXTENT**: Daily sea ice extent in km¬≤.
- **SEA_ICE_AREA**: Daily sea ice area in km¬≤.

## Workflow

### 1. Data Processing
- Combines the Chukchi and Southern Beaufort sea ice datasets.
- Adds new features:
  - **Rolling Averages**: Smooths data to highlight trends.
  - **Daily Differences**: Captures day-to-day changes.
  - **Cyclical Features**: Uses sine and cosine transformations to model seasonal patterns.
- Saves processed data for analysis and modeling.

### 2. Model Training
- Trains a **Random Forest Regressor** to predict sea ice extent using features such as:
  - Year, day, rolling averages, and daily differences.
- The trained model is saved for future predictions.

### 3. Evaluation
- Tests the trained model's accuracy using unseen data.
- Key metrics include:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures average prediction error.
  - **R¬≤ (R-Squared)**: Indicates how well the model explains the variability in the data.

### 4. Trend Visualization
- Generates visualizations of sea ice trends, including:
  - Daily sea ice extent and area with rolling averages.
  - Day-to-day changes in sea ice extent.
