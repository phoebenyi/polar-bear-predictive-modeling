Sea-ice data are provided in two text files: "Chukchi Sea ice data.txt" and "Southern Beaufort Sea ice data.txt". 
The data and methods to process them are described in the main text of Regehr et al. (2017) and the Supporting Information Appendix S3. 
Ice data are provided for within the polar bear subpopulation areas as defined by the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group (Obbard et al. 2010). 
Each text file includes 12926 lines with four numbers per line:

YEAR: calendar year 1979-2014
DAY: 1 to 365
SEA-IC E-EXTENT:  daily sea-ice extent in kilometers^2
SEA-ICE-AREA:  daily sea-ice area in kilometers^2
